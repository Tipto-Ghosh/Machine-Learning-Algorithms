# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms – From Scratch to Production

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! This project is designed to serve as a **one-stop resource** for understanding, implementing, and deploying popular machine learning algorithms. It combines **theoretical rigor**, **hands-on coding**, and **practical insights** to help learners and professionals deeply understand how machine learning works under the hood.

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here:

* 🧮 **Mathematical Foundations**: Step-by-step derivations and intuition for each algorithm
* 🛠️ **Python Implementations from Scratch**: Learn how algorithms work by building them yourself
* 🧪 **Interactive Examples & Demos**: Visualize how models behave with different inputs and data patterns
* 🤖 **scikit-learn Implementations**: Explore how each algorithm is applied in real-world scenarios using sklearn
* 🔁 **Theory-to-Practice Transition**: Seamless mapping between pure math and production-ready code

## 📌 Motivation

Many machine learning courses and tutorials either focus **only on high-level application** or dive **too deeply into theory** without showing how it's applied. This repository aims to bridge that gap by:

* 💡 **Breaking down mathematical reasoning** in an intuitive, beginner-friendly manner
* 🔧 **Reconstructing each algorithm from the ground up** to reinforce conceptual clarity
* 🔄 **Juxtaposing custom and sklearn implementations** for better comparison and understanding
* 🌍 **Applying algorithms to real-world datasets and problems** through demos and use cases

This approach helps reinforce both the “**how**” and “**why**” of each algorithm, fostering a deeper, more transferable understanding of machine learning.
